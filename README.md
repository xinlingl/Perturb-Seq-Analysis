# Perturb-Seq-Analysis
This project contains two parts. 
Goal: identify gene-gene relationship and the effect of perturbation on gene expression using linear regression 


Part 1: MAGIC retrieval followed by consensus clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data

Part 2: Perturbation analysis using linear regression
