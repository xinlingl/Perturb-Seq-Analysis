# Perturb-Seq-Analysis

Goal: Develop a pipeline to analyze perturb-seq data and identify the effect of perturbation on gene expression using linear regression model. The pipeline was then used to study genes that function in cell cycle regulation of human leukemia cell lines.

Please read project report.pdf for more information about our pipeline.

This project contains two parts: 

Part 1: Imputation by MAGIC followed by consensus clustering of scRNA-seq data by SC3

Part 2: Joint analysis of scRNA-seq and CRISPR perturbation data using linear regression model
