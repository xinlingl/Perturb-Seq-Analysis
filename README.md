# Perturb-Seq-Analysis

Goal: Develop a pipeline to analyze perturb-seq data and identify the effect of perturbation on gene expression using linear regression model. The pipeline was then used to study genes that function in cell cycle regulation of human leukemia cell lines.

This project contains two parts. 

Part 1: Imputation by MAGIC followed by consensus clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data by SC3

Part 2: Perturbation analysis using linear regression model
