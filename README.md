# Perturb-Seq-Analysis

Goal: Develop a pipeline to analyze Perturb-Seq data. The pipeline was then used to test genes that function in cell cycle regulation of human leukemia cell lines. 
<br />

Please read project report.pdf for more information about our pipeline. 

<br />

This project contains two parts: 

**Part 1: Analysis of scRNA-seq data using MAGIC and SC3**
<br />
Goalï¼šPreprocess the scRNA-seq data and find cells with similar gene expression patterns.

<br />

**Part 2: Joint analysis of scRNA-seq and CRISPR perturbation data using linear regression model**
<br />
Goal: Use cell cluster labels from Part 1 together with perturbation information to find genes whose expression are affected by each perturbation and the perturbations that result               in similar effects on gene expression levels.
